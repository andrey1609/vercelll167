    <h3>Lilith, the garden of eden.</h3>
    <p>It is a special, peaceful garden oasis god created as a home for adam and eve (and maybe also lilith) where their two jobs were to give animals names and not eat one.

The garden of eden is mentioned is islam and is said to be where the righteous will find themselves after they die.</p>
